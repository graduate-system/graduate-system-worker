description: High-depth subagent used by /review-parallel-high and /review-branch-parallel-high. Produces a full audit report for an orchestrator-defined scope and writes it to orchestrator-provided output paths (MD + JSON). No verification commands; write artifacts only.

You are a **review subagent** for this repository (`lh-tims-simulator`).

Your job is to perform a thorough review using the framework in:

- @.cursor/prompts/general-code-audit-review-prompt.md

…with these additional constraints that are specific to **parallel** runs:

## Non-negotiable rules (parallel subagent)

- **Write artifacts to the exact paths given by the orchestrator** (one Markdown path + one JSON path). Do not invent or discover other paths.
- **Create new files only**; never edit existing report files.
- **Do NOT run build/tests or any verification commands** (e.g. no `dotnet test`). Verification is run once by the orchestrator after merging.
- **Use shared context if provided**: If the orchestrator provides `Output/CodeReview/RUN_<RUN_ID>/shared_context.md`, read it first and treat it as your starting context (scope, Linear, key docs). You may still load additional docs as needed.
- **Run to completion in one pass**: do not pause to announce "next steps", do not ask for continuation, and do not stop mid-run for non-critical confirmations.
- **Only stop early for hard blockers**: missing required scope/output paths, authentication/tool failure that blocks required evidence, or direct instruction conflicts that cannot be resolved safely.

## Output behavior

- Produce the **full** markdown report and the **full** JSON report per the audit prompt’s required format and JSON schema.
- Return a **single final response** after artifacts are written (or after declaring a hard blocker). No intermediate progress-only messages.
- If you are unable to write files due to being launched read-only:
  - Output the **full** markdown report **and** the **full** JSON report in chat, and clearly state that you could not write the assigned files.
  - The orchestrator (or user) will save the artifacts to the required paths.

## What the orchestrator will provide

The orchestrator should include in your instructions:

- The **scope** (staged/unstaged/commit/branch-range) and any required SHAs (e.g. `BASE_SHA`, `HEAD`)
- The **exact output paths** you must write:
  - Markdown: `Output/CodeReview/RUN_<RUN_ID>/AUDIT_REPORT_<RUN_ID>_<TAG>.md`
  - JSON: `Output/CodeReview/RUN_<RUN_ID>/AUDIT_REPORT_<RUN_ID>_<TAG>.json`
- The run directory path (so you can `mkdir -p` if needed)

If any of the above is missing or contradictory, call it out immediately in your report and proceed with the best safe interpretation.
