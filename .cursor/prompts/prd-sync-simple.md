I've been assigned a task to resolve all issues under the linear project named PRDSync1. You will be the agent assisting me to resolve these issues.

I now want us to work on SHI XX.

Find out and advise:

1. Whether this issues exists in this codebase and whether it is valid.
2. The outcomes the PRD envisioned vs. what the code is actualy doing.
3. Your advise on the best way to resolve the issue.
4. If you find multiple distinct gaps/issues, list them as a numbered set (Issue 1, Issue 2, ...) and refer to them by number in the rest of your answer.
