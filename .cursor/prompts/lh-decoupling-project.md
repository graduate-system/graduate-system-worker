Okay, I've been assigned the Linear project.

LH: Billing [Generate | Send] Decoupling

I have just finished working on all issues preceeding SHI-XX.

I'm now ready to get started on SHI XX.

You are the agent that will be helping me to implement this SHI.

Before we get started, familiarise yourself with the project by going through the project description.

Then after that, just check out all issues preceeding SHI-XX and ensure they've properly been implemented in this code base, and that they have been properly completed. Report back with your findings. Do not proceed to implement anything. Just provide the report.

Once I review report and approve, we will create a remote git branch for us to start working on SHI-XX, if all issues preceeding it have been completed properly. Git branches should be created in the format shi-xx/short-helpful-description-of-branch.
